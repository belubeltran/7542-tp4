On two occasions I have been asked, â€” " Pray, Mr. Babbage, 
if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right 
answers come out ?" In one case a member of the Upper, 
and in the other a member of the Lower, House put this 
question. I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of 
confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question. I did, 
however, explain the following property, which might in some 
measure approach towards an answer to it. 

It is possible to construct the Analytical Engine in such a 
manner that after the question is once communicated to the 
engine, it may be stopped at any turn of the handle and set 
on again as often as may be desired. At each stoppage every 
figure- wheel throughout the Engine, which is capable of being 
moved without breaking, may be moved on to any other 
digit Yet after each of these apparent fsJsifications the 
engine will be found to make the next calculation with 
perfect truth. 

The explanation is very simple, and the property itself 
useless. The whole of the mechanism ought of course to be 
enclosed in glass, and kept under lock and key, in which case 
the mechanism necessary to give it the property alluded to 
would be useless.
